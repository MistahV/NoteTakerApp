# Application Name: Note Taker


## Description

Welcome to the Note Taker application! For many people, it can be hard in the course of the day to keep track of your thoughts - whether it is a cool idea, a joke you came up, or an attempt to remind yourself about that task you need to complete later. Well look no further - this application provides an easy-to-use UI that will let you quickly enter notes, save them to the database, and then view older notes!

This application should be ready to go right from download. You may need to do an 'npm install' command with the package.json file in your CLI to ensure that Express and all necessary packages are installed. When you're ready, simply open up the application in your integrated terminal, and enter 'node server.js' to start. Navigate to your localhost, and voila! You will be able to start jotting down your notes and saving them to the database right away!
